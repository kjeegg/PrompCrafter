# PromptCrafter Usage Guide

This guide explains how you would typically use the PromptCrafter application to help you create and understand instructions for AI models. PromptCrafter is a personal tool designed to make your interactions with AI more effective.

**Before You Start:** This guide assumes the PromptCrafter application is running and accessible, likely through a web browser interface on your computer.

## Using the PromptCrafter Interface

The application provides a straightforward way to input what you want an AI to do and receive assistance in crafting the best way to ask it.

1.  **Describe Your Goal:** Find the main input area (usually a text box). Here, you will clearly describe the task or question you have in mind for an AI. For example, you might enter: "I need help writing a job application cover letter for a marketing position."

2.  **Initiate Prompt Creation:** Look for a button, perhaps labeled "Generate Prompt" or "Craft Prompt". Clicking this tells PromptCrafter to start processing your goal.

3.  **Review Suggestions and Analysis:** The application will analyze your goal and provide output that might include:
    *   **Refined Goal Breakdown:** How the system understands your request.
    *   **Suggested Prompt Text:** Different options or components for your AI prompt.
    *   **Potential AI Steps:** A simplified view of how an AI might process the prompt.

4.  **Refine Your Prompt:** Based on the suggestions and analysis, you can adjust your initial goal or the generated prompt text within the application to make it even clearer.

5.  **Use Your Crafted Prompt:** Once you are satisfied with the prompt generated by PromptCrafter, you can copy it and paste it into the AI tool you are using (like ChatGPT, Bard, etc.).

## Example Scenario

Let's say you want an AI to summarize a long article for you.

1.  **Describe Goal:** You input: "Summarize this article about renewable energy trends."
2.  **PromptCrafter Processes:** The tool identifies the core task (summarize) and the topic (renewable energy trends).
3.  **Provides Guidance:** PromptCrafter might suggest adding details to your prompt, such as:
    *   What is the source of the article (if you can provide a link or text)?
    *   What is the desired length of the summary (e.g., a few sentences, a paragraph)?
    *   Who is the summary for (e.g., a quick overview for yourself, a summary for a colleague)?
    Based on your input, it helps you build a more effective prompt like: "Summarize the following article [paste article text here] into three key bullet points for a non-expert audience."
4.  **Final Step:** You take this refined prompt and use it in your AI tool.

PromptCrafter is designed to guide you through this process, making your interactions with AI more successful and predictable.
